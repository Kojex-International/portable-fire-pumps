This repository documents a live production distributor website for **Shibaura portable fire pumps**, built for **Kojex International** to deliver product information, technical documentation, and inquiry workflows for North American buyers and partners.

🌐 Live site: [https://www.portable-fire-pumps.com](https://www.portable-fire-pumps.com)

It is built with **Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript** using an Astro-first, low-JavaScript architecture.

## My Role

Although this repository is hosted under the **Kojex International** organization, the site architecture and implementation were developed by **Nicholas Matsumoto**.

- Migrated the legacy Wix site to a modern Astro static architecture
- Designed the modular fire pump product data system
- Implemented bilingual routing across the entire site (`/en/` and `/fr/`)
- Built product detail pages and technical documentation resources
- Structured the Resources section for manuals, catalogs, and parts references
- Implemented SEO metadata, sitemap generation, and environment-aware indexing behavior
- Deployed and maintained the production site on Netlify
- Preserved a low-JavaScript, Astro-first rendering model across the site

## Architecture Highlights

- Astro-first architecture keeps most pages fully static and minimizes client-side JavaScript
- React islands are used only where interaction is required, such as forms and navigation
- Modular fire pump data files support scalable product detail rendering across models
- Bilingual route structure is maintained consistently under `/en/` and `/fr/`
- Static site generation supports fast delivery, crawlability, and SEO control
- The Resources section is structured as a documentation system for distributors and operators

## Project Background

Kojex International distributes Shibaura portable fire pumps, and this site provides the product information and technical resources needed by distributors, procurement teams, and emergency response organizations. It replaces a legacy Wix implementation with a modern static platform focused on maintainability, performance, bilingual publishing, and documentation delivery.

## Repository Purpose

This repository powers the Portable Fire Pumps website as a distributor-focused product information and technical documentation platform.

It is not an ecommerce storefront. The site is designed to:
- Present pump model pages and supporting product information
- Publish technical manuals, catalogs, parts lists, and related resources
- Support distributor-facing credibility and capture contact / RFQ inquiries

## Project Status

The project is under active development with a focus on product depth, technical clarity, and commercial usability.

Current priorities:
- Expanding model-specific product pages across the lineup
- Improving technical resources, manuals, and documentation coverage
- Refining SEO, performance, and lead-generation content across EN/FR routes

## ✨ Features

- **Bilingual EN/FR routing** across marketing, product, and documentation pages
- **Technical product detail pages** with structured specifications, media, and supporting resources
- **Documentation and resources system** for catalogs, manuals, and parts references
- **RFQ and contact workflow** using Netlify Forms and serverless email notifications
- **SEO-friendly static architecture** with canonical URLs, hreflang, sitemap, and structured data
- **Responsive design** for desktop, tablet, and mobile use
- **Low-JS Astro-first architecture** with interactive behavior isolated to React islands

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Astro 5** for routing and static page generation
- **React 19** for interactive UI islands
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling and responsive layouts
- **TypeScript** for type-safe components and structured data models
- **Lucide React** for interface iconography

## Component Conventions

Use **Astro components** by default. Astro-first architecture keeps runtime JavaScript low and improves page performance.

Astro components should be used for:
- Static content
- Page layouts
- SEO content
- Product detail pages
- Documentation pages

React components should be used only for:
- Interactive UI
- Forms
- Dynamic elements

Examples of valid React island usage:
- RFQ form
- Mobile navigation
- Interactive UI elements (tabs, reveal interactions, card toggles)

Minimize client-side JavaScript whenever possible. If a section can render statically, keep it in Astro.

## 📦 Pages Included

- **Home** - Brand overview and primary entry point into the site
- **Products** - Category listings and detailed pump model pages
- **Features** - Capability-focused pages for key pump systems and product advantages
- **Distributors** - Distributor network information and partner-facing content
- **Resources** - Catalogs, manuals, parts lists, and technical documentation
- **Contact / RFQ** - Inquiry capture and request-for-quote workflow

## 🌐 Bilingual Routing Structure

- English pages are served under `/en/...`
- French pages are served under `/fr/...`
- User-facing pages should be maintained as EN/FR route pairs
- Navigation and internal linking should stay aligned across both locales

## Route Naming Conventions

English routes:
- `/en/products/`
- `/en/resources/`
- `/en/features/`
- `/en/distributors/`

French routes:
- `/fr/products/`
- `/fr/resources/`
- `/fr/features/`
- `/fr/distributors/`

EN and FR routes should remain structurally aligned to support maintainability, localization consistency, and predictable navigation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kojex-International/portable-fire-pumps.git
cd portable-fire-pumps
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser

## 📝 Configuration

### Site Configuration

Core site metadata, canonical URL handling, and social profile links are defined in `src/config/site.ts`:

```typescript
export const SITE = {
  title: 'Portable Fire Pumps',
  description: 'High-performance portable fire pumps for fire prevention and disaster relief sectors',
  url: 'https://www.portable-fire-pumps.com',
  author: 'Kojex International',
} as const;

export const SOCIAL_LINKS = {
  twitter: 'https://twitter.com/shibaura_bousai',
  facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556205597560',
  instagram: 'https://www.instagram.com/shibaura_fire_pump/',
  youtube: 'https://www.youtube.com/@shibaura6004',
} as const;
```

### Form Integration

The RFQ form (`src/components/forms/RFQForm.tsx`) is currently integrated with Netlify Forms and a serverless email workflow. If you need to adapt it for another backend or hosted form service:

1. **Option 1: Form Service** (Recommended for static sites)
   - Use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/), or similar
   - Update the submission flow in `RFQForm.tsx`

2. **Option 2: Custom API**
   - Create an API endpoint or serverless function
   - Update the form submission handler accordingly

Example with Formspree:
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
  
  const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
    headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    // Show success message
  }
};
```

## Product Rendering Architecture

- Product detail pages use thin locale wrappers:
  - `src/pages/en/products/[slug].astro`
  - `src/pages/fr/products/[slug].astro`
- Shared product rendering is centralized in:
  - `src/components/products/ProductDetailPageContent.astro`
- Product content is sourced from the modular firepump data API (`getFirepumps(...)`), keeping page templates declarative and minimizing duplicated EN/FR markup.

### Product Page Flow

The current product page architecture flows from route wrappers to shared rendering and then to the firepump data layer.

```text
EN/FR Route
    ↓
[slug].astro
    ↓
ProductDetailPageContent.astro
    ↓
src/data/firepumps/index.ts
    ↓
pumps/<model>.ts
```

## Firepump Data Architecture

- `src/data/firepumps.ts` is a compatibility layer that re-exports from `src/data/firepumps/index.ts`.
- `src/data/firepumps/index.ts` assembles pump modules, runs validation, and exports `getFirepumps(locale)`.
- Each pump model is defined under `src/data/firepumps/pumps/`.
- Supporting modules are split by responsibility:
  - `localize.ts` (EN/FR value localization)
  - `validation.ts` (hero/spec schema validation)
  - `media.ts` (shared media/manual assets)
  - `spec-utils.ts` and `spec-types.ts` (spec table helpers/types)
  - `frReplacements.ts` (French normalization replacements)

## 🗂️ Asset Organization

- Store source-managed images and graphics in `src/assets/`
- Store direct public files (favicons, static media, non-bundled assets) in `public/`
- Keep product-related media grouped by model family where practical
- Keep archived/deprecated template assets under `src/archive/`

## Asset Naming Guidelines

- Use lowercase only
- Use kebab-case only
- Use descriptive names; avoid generic names like `image1`, `final-v2`, `IMG_1234`
- Include model numbers when relevant
- Keep hero/support images separate from product/model assets
- Archive deprecated assets rather than deleting them

Recommended naming patterns:
- Product photos: `shibaura-{model}-portable-fire-pump-{view}.ext`
- Performance overview images: `{model}-performance-overview-graph.ext`
- Performance charts: `{model}-performance-curve.ext`
- Dimensions diagrams: `{model}-dimensions-diagram.ext`
- Hero/support images: `{context}-{role}.ext`
- Brand assets: `shibaura-wordmark.ext`, `shibaura-logo-mark.ext`

Examples:
- `shibaura-ff500ar-portable-fire-pump-side-view.jpg`
- `ft510-performance-overview-graph.png`
- `ff500-dimensions-diagram.jpg`
- `distributors-network-hero.png`
- `shibaura-wordmark.svg`

## Alt Text Standards

- Meaningful content images must have descriptive alt text
- Decorative images should use `alt=""`
- Describe the image naturally; do not repeat filenames
- Avoid keyword stuffing
- Include model/context where useful for product and technical imagery

Examples:
- `Side view of the Shibaura FT510 portable fire pump`
- `Performance curve for the Shibaura P572S portable fire pump`
- `Diagram showing a portable fire pump relay system used in wildfire operations`

### Image Audit

Run `npm run audit:images` to scan active source files for:
- `<img>` or `<Image>` tags missing `alt`
- weak literal alt values such as `image`, `photo`, `picture`, or `logo`
- generic asset filename references in active imports

Scope: `src/pages/`, `src/components/`, `src/layouts/` (excluding archived content).

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors

The site uses Tailwind CSS. Customize colors in `src/styles/global.css` or update Tailwind config.

### Images

Store production images in `src/assets/` and public static media in `public/`.

### Content

- Update page and section copy in `src/pages/` and related components
- Modify navigation in `src/config/site.ts`
- Maintain EN/FR parity for user-facing pages
- Keep product/resource data aligned with `src/data/`

## ➕ Adding a New Pump Model

1. Add a new model file under `src/data/firepumps/pumps/`.
2. Export/include it in `src/data/firepumps/index.ts` so it is part of the validated `firepumps` array.
3. Add required media/manual assets via `src/data/firepumps/media.ts` (or existing asset/data locations as appropriate).
4. Verify EN/FR product detail routes resolve via `src/pages/en/products/[slug].astro` and `src/pages/fr/products/[slug].astro`.
5. Confirm listing/card surfaces include the new model where needed.
6. Run `npm run build` and validate hero/spec/resources output for both locales.

## Page Creation Checklist

- Create EN route
- Create FR route
- Confirm route naming consistency
- Add metadata and title
- Confirm images load correctly
